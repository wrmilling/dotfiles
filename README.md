# dotfiles

dotfiles have been migrated to [nixos-configuration](https://git.sr.ht/~wrmilling/nixos-configuration) which utilizes [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to manage state and custom packages. 

This repository will be kept live for posterity and while I migrate all my machines to the new configuration.
